## Description
This project was completed in order to showcase my knowledge of working with back end programming.  This project was refactored using MySql2, Sequelize, and dotenv.

The assigment desctiption is as follows: 

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Badges
MySql by Oracle.

All of the coding methods in this project were those that were learned during the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp as well as some open source searches on mysql and sequelize.
